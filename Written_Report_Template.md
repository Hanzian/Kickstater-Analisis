# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

* Show the best month to launch a fundraising for the parent category Theater.

* Know the objective to set for the next fundraising of the sub-category "Plays".


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

We find that during the months of May and June, we have more attendance in the Theaters. However, may is the best month to launch a fundraiser in this category.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

According to our analysis, Louise is more likely to achieve her goals when the amounts do not exceed $15,000.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

1. Difficulties about how to use the formula "COUNTIFS"
    
    - To solve this issue, I watched a tip video in the link below
    [COUNTIFS Functions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/countifs-function-dda3dc6e-f74e-4aee-88bc-aa8c2a866842?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us)


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?


    * May is the best month to launch a fundraising in Theater


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?


    * For the next fundraising in "Plays" Subcategory, Louise have to limit the amount goals to $15,000.
    

- What are some limitations of this dataset?



- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
